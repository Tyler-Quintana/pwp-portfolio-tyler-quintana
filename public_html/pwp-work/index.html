    <h2 #="About Me">Get To Know Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Tyler Quintana. I am an Albuquerque based Fullstack Website Developer. I started learning to code in 2021 by teaching myself the basics. I decided I wanted to dive head first into the industry and jumped into the CNM Deep Dive Bootcamp in 2022. It has helped me increase my skills with languages such as HTML and CSS. As well as teach me entirely new skill sets such as using JavaScript, git, GitHub,  Node, the command line, Bootstrap, and MySQL. It has also helped me with my soft skills such as what it is really like to work with a team on big projects</p>
