<h1>Purpose, Audience and Goal</h1>

<p>My PWP will serve as a location where I can display my works and accomplishments to potential future employers,

    to my future prospects.</p>

<h2>Audience</h2>

    individuals who are looking at my projects and wish to see some evidence of the work I have completed and what
    skills I already know and can bring to a team.</p>
