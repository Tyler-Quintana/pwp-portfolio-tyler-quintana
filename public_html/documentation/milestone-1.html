<h1>Purpose, Audience and Goal</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>My PWP will serve as a location where I can display my works and accomplishments to potential future employers,
    fellow developers and my peers. Having my PWP be an ever-growing portfolio of my skill set will be very valuable
    to my future prospects.</p>

<h2>Audience</h2>

<p>The people I envision using this site are potential employers, professional peers and possible customers. This can
    also include any business who would be interested in an internship opportunity. This site will be designed for
    individuals who are looking at my projects and wish to see some evidence of the work I have completed and what
    skills I already know and can bring to a team.</p>

<h2>Goal</h2>

<p>The goal of this PWP is to either find employment in the field post graduation, or help me get into an internship
    for a company. The goal is the move forward will my career in one way or another and this PWP can be a really useful
    asset to have when entering the next phase of starting a career.</p>
