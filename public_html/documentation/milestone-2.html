<h1>Content Strategy</h1>

<p>My personal website will be one page, and will have the following sections:</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This will display my full name as well as my role as a front end fullstack web developer. The background will have a picture of something such as mountains.</p>

<h2>Get To Know Me</h2>

<p>This will be a brief description of who I am and what my experience is. This is where I can explain how I am going through the bootcamp as well as list out what technical and soft skills I possess. It will be important to list and display in a clear way what languages I know as well as other important skills (such as git and github). This will come across as professional, with maybe a slight hint of humor to make it relatable.</p>

<h2>My Projects</h2>

<p>This will display my work via images and descriptions of each project. It will contain a brief explanation as to what each project was intended for, how it was created as well as what software and languages where used.</p>

<h2>Contact Me</h2>

<p>This will be a section where individuals can fill out a contact form in order to get in touch with me if they are interested. I will also have links to my professional email address, my GitHub as well as my LinkedIn.</p>
